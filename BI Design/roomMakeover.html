            This sweet girl had grown out of her "too baby-ish" pink bedroom and wanted something more "tween". Her mother decided to surprise her with a room makeover while Molly was away on summer vacation with her dad.<br><br>
            The budget to update the bedroom and bathroom was 2K.  There was no room in that budget to replace the window treatments in the bedroom, purchase new furniture or paint.  The bedroom had been painted yellow and the bathroom was an "aggressive" bright blue.
            We purchased a wonderful BOHO bedding ensemble that incorporated the more tween "dusty pink" with gold, touches of orange as well as yellow which beautifully tied in the yellow walls with the new dusty pink palette. <br><br>
          </p>

          <div class = 'contentImage' id = 'side'>
            <img src = './images/roomMakeover/makeover1.jpg'>
          </div>
          <p id = 'sideText'>
            We echoed the color palette in the en-suite bathroom which ultimately meant repainting as the "aggressive blue" was definitely not working!  We updated to a soft gray which is a compliment to the yellow / dusty pink bedroom and was the perfect backdrop for the new shower curtain, wall art and accessories.<br><br>
          </p>
            <p>
              The new room design incorporated a lounge area under the window with a fun, faux fur rug and pouf pillows - Molly's favorite part of the redo!  I also added a storage bench at the foot of the bed and created a bit of magic by draping fabric over part of the bed canopy with a battery operated Edison bulb underneath.  The rest of the transformation was accomplished with new accessories and voila!<br><br>
              Molly said she felt like she was on an episode of Fixer Upper and absolutely loved her new, more grown-up space!
