          Helpful Hanging Tips We've Learned Along the Way
        </h2>
        <p>
          <br>
          Measure your wall space (width and height). Lay out  planters in your desired pattern on the floor. Mark all nailholes on the wall with a pencil before you put your first nail in.  Remember to take into account the size of the planters as well as the size of the spaces in between:  size of planters + size of spaces = total  design area.
          <br><br>
          Alternating circles and squares are easier to hang than trying to hang squares only.  You can hang all squares but your measurements have to be spot on!
          <br><br>
          Three to four inch spacing between  12" planters works nicely. Two to three inch spacing between 9" planters.
