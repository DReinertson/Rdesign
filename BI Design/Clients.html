          “Denise did a beautiful job transforming my daughter’s bedroom into her dream space. In a short amount of time (the transformation was a surprise we pulled off while she was traveling) Denise created and executed a vision that was spot-on for my 10-year old daughter and something she can continue to grow with. Denise was amazing to work with. She incorporated many pieces we already had and gave everything a new cohesive look that is gorgeous! She stayed right on budget and If we couldn’t find the perfect piece- she made it! From choosing paint colors to accessorizing- the whole process was a blast. Denise is so talented and very fun to work with.”
